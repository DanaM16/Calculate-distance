# Calculate-distance
Hello world! This is my very first program. It calculates the shortest distance between two points using the Haversine formula. The Haversine formula determines the great-circle distance between two points on a sphere given their longitudes and latitudes. Important in navigation, it is a special case of a more general formula in spherical trigonometry, the law of Haversines, that relates the sides and angles of spherical triangles.

It's a short and a simple program where all that the user needs to do is to enter the names of the two points and the four coordinates, and then chosing between four different types of measurments. At the end the program asks you if you want to repeat everything again.
